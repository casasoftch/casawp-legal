<h2 id="term_1">Privacy policy</h2>
<p>The following privacy policy applies to the use of this website. It is generally possible to use our website without providing personal data. However, if you would like to use a special service offered by our company via our website, personal data may need to be processed.</p>
<p>This website is subject to the provisions of the <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/oc/2022/491/de" target="_blank">Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)</a> and complies with the key points of the European Union (EU) <a href="https://www.gdprexplained.eu/de/" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>.</p>
<p>Within the scope of the applicable data protection legislation and technical possibilities, we strive to ensure the security of your data. We will generally transmit your personal data in encrypted form. We use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encoding system. However, please note that the transmission of data via the internet (e.g. communication by email) may be subject to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This privacy policy is continuously updated and adapted in line with legal requirements and the services that we offer. The latest version of the privacy policy always applies. Changes enter into force as soon as they are published on our website.</p>
<h2 id="term_2">Processing of personal data</h2>
<p>You have the option to register for various services on the website by providing personal data. The personal data that is transmitted to the party responsible for processing is generally determined by the particular input screen used for registration.</p>
<p><strong>Personal data</strong> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person. For example, this may include a person's name, address, email address or telephone number. We may process this type of personal data. <strong>Processing</strong> means any operation or set of operations that is performed on personal data, whether or not by automated means, including collection, recording, organisation, sorting, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
<p><strong>The personal data that you submit is collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the party responsible for processing and for our own purposes. Wherever possible, data will be anonymised. Anonymisation means that no conclusions can be drawn about the data subject.</strong></p>
<p>The criterion for the duration of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period or a legitimate interest on our part in its storage, e.g. the fulfilment of the contract or the preservation of evidence. The corresponding data is then routinely erased.</p>
<h2 id="term_3">Data collected directly by us</h2>
<p>When you use our website and associated services, we may collect the following personal data:</p>
<h3 id="term_3_1">Enquiry forms</h3>
<p>If you are interested in a particular property listing, you may send us an enquiry via a contact form. The personal data that is transmitted during this enquiry is determined by the input screen in question. Your data may be recorded manually using software from a third-party provider or may be imported via an interface. Depending on the stored data, we may send you other property listings corresponding to the criteria of your enquiry. Relevant property listings may be identified manually or automatically via software. We may notify you of such property listings via email, letter or telephone. You have the option to unsubscribe from this service at any time.</p>
<h3 id="term_3_2">Creating a property search profile</h3>
<p>Our website gives users the opportunity to store a property search profile by completing a form. The aim of a property search profile is to share your property search preferences with us. The personal data that is transmitted when you store a form is determined by the input screen used.</p>
<p>The personal data collected to create a property search profile is used exclusively to send you information about suitable property listings. The data transmitted may be recorded manually using software from a third-party provider or may be imported via an interface. If properties that meet the search criteria are available, we may notify you by email, letter or telephone. We may also contact you periodically to update your personal data in the property search profile. You have the option of temporarily deactivating or completely deleting your property search profile at any time.</p>
<h3 id="term_3_3">Registering for the newsletter</h3>
<p>You can subscribe to our company's newsletter using the form or by email. If possible, a confirmation email is sent to the email address entered in the double opt-in process when the newsletter is sent for the first time. You have the option to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. A link to unsubscribe can be found in every newsletter. If this link is missing, please contact the data protection officer for our website. </p>
<p>Our newsletter may contain a tracking pixel. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such emails to enable recording and analysis of log files. These are used to statistically evaluate the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. The analysis may be performed using anonymised or identifiable personal data. You can deactivate the loading of these external graphics/tracking pixels in the settings of all common email programs.</p>
<h3 id="term_3_4">Data collection during an application process</h3>
<p>We may collect and process personal data provided by applicants during an application process. Processing may also be carried out electronically. This is particularly the case when applicants submit application documents to us electronically, for example via email or a form on the website. The data transmitted will only be used in connection with the requested job profile.</p>
<h2 id="term_4">Data collected via third-party services</h2>
<p>In order to continuously improve the quality of our services, we use the following technologies on our website:</p>
<h3 id="term_4_1">Cookies</h3>
<p>We may sometimes use cookies. Cookies can be used to optimise the information and offers on our website with the users in mind. Cookies enable us to recognise users of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make the use of our website easier for users. You may prevent our website from setting cookies by adjusting the browser settings you use, thereby permanently blocking cookies.</p>
<h3 id="term_4_2">Use of Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Our web analytics includes the anonymous collection and analysis of data concerning the behaviour of visitors to our website. The data recorded by a web analytics service includes information on the third-party website from which a user came to our website, which subpages were accessed, and how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. Google Analytics sets a cookie in order to record this information. As mentioned above, you can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by configuring the corresponding setting in your internet browser.</p>
<h3 id="term_4_3">Use of script libraries</h3>
<p>In order to deliver content correctly or prevent spam, we use script libraries and font libraries on our website (e.g. Google Webfonts for fonts, Google Ratings for ratings or Google Recaptcha to protect the website from spam). The retrieval of a script library or font library results in a connection to the provider of the library. It is possible that the operator of the library may collect data on this connection.</p>
<h3 id="term_4_4">Use of Google Maps</h3>
<p>We use an interface to geographical data from Google to display location-based information. Google collects and uses data on the use of the map function. Information on how Google uses data is available in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Google privacy policy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="term_4_5">Use of social plug-ins</h3>
<p>Plug-ins from various social network providers may be used on our website. The relevant social networks include these plug-ins to use certain information, which may also include personal data. If the data subject is simultaneously logged in to a social network while visiting our website, it can be assumed that personal data will be transmitted to the social networks. We have no control over which data is used by social networks. We do not use social plug-ins to record personal data. The privacy policies of the corresponding social networks provide information on the collection, processing and use of personal data.</p>
<h2 id="term_5">Disclosure of your data to third parties</h2>
<p>We may disclose your data to domestic and foreign law enforcement authorities and courts in order to combat fraud and misuse or in the event of any other suspicion of criminal acts.</p>
<p>Apart from the disclosure of your data described above, we will only pass on your data if you have expressly consented to this in accordance with applicable data protection law, if there is a legal obligation to do so or if this is necessary to enforce our rights, in particular to enforce claims arising from the contractual relationship, which is an overriding interest of ours.</p>
<h2 id="term_6">Transfer of personal data abroad</h2>
<p>We may also transfer your personal data to third-party companies or contracted service providers abroad, in particular in Europe and the USA, insofar as this is appropriate for the data processing described in this privacy policy. They are obligated to ensure data protection to the same extent we are. If the level of data protection in a country does not correspond to that in Switzerland, we will contractually ensure that the protection of your personal data corresponds to that in Switzerland at all times. We ensure this by concluding EU Model Clauses or other contracts approved by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner with the commissioned service providers.</p>
<h2 id="term_7">Duration of storage of your data</h2>
<p>We will only retain your data for as long as is legally necessary or as required for the purpose of processing, in particular for the fulfilment of the order or contract and for compliance with legal obligations.</p>
<p>When analysing your data, we store your data until the analysis is complete or you have objected to further processing. If we store data on the basis of a contractual relationship with you, this data will remain stored for at least as long as the contractual relationship exists and for no longer than the statute of limitations for possible claims or statutory or contractual retention obligations.</p>
<p>The contents of the contact form and the following email correspondence must be retained by us for six months by law.</p>
<p>It will then be erased if we no longer need your data for the stated processing purposes and are no longer legally obliged to store it.</p>
<h2 id="term_8">Protection of your data</h2>
<p>We take appropriate technical and organisational precautions to carefully protect your data against loss, destruction, falsification, manipulation or unauthorised access. We operate secure data networks that comply with the applicable technical standards. Our security measures are continually being adapted and improved in line with technological developments.</p>
<p>Our employees and the service companies commissioned by us are obliged by us to maintain confidentiality and to comply with data protection regulations.</p>
<h2 id="term_9">Your rights as a user of our website</h2>
<p>Under applicable law, you have various rights with regard to your personal data. You may contact our data protection officer to assert the following rights:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Information on your stored data and processing of this data</li>
	<li>Rectification of inaccurate personal data</li>
	<li>Erasure of your stored data</li>
	<li>Restriction of the processing of data if we are not yet able to erase your data due to legal obligations</li>
	<li>Objection to the processing of your data</li>
	<li>Data portability, i.e. the receipt of stored data in a machine-readable format, if you have consented to data processing or concluded a contract with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that, in some cases, the granting of your rights may be refused or restricted for legal reasons or based on data protection law. If legally required or permitted, we will inform you of the reasons for our decision.</p>
